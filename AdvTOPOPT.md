Recent advances in Topology optimization (ALM) 23/11/18 [at ENSAM Bordeaux](https://github.com/mid2SUPAERO/Outputs/blob/master/Presentation_JMSC_FA.pdf)

You can find in top88 repository all the files, paper, and ...

[The 3 point bending projected corrected using top88](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/ALMcourse/blob/master/top88/topopt_3ptBENDING.html)

for people wondering about how linear elasticity of top88.m is working

Prof, can you help to us understand how to compute the stiffness matrix of 2D membrane?
Explictely ?  [Membrane2D_K](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse/blob/master/Membrane2D_K/Elementarystiffrecmesh.html)


Have a look in the top3D repository to do the same but in 3D !!!

Part A:  [Constraints Agreggation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse/blob/master/AdvancedTopOpt/ConstraintsAgreggation.html)
Thanks to my PhD Simone.

Part B:  [Stress Based TopOpt](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse/blob/master/AdvancedTopOpt/StressBasedTopOpt.html)
Thanks **AGAIN** to my PhD Simone.
Before you can use Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) as an optimizer in our stress based topology optimization program, you need to obtain the Matlab implementation of MMA from Prof. Krister Svanberg (krille@math.kth.se) from KTH in Stockholm Sweden.
