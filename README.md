This webpage contains **only** tutorials.
The slides of the different courses are available on *SUPAERO's LMS*. 

1st MATLAB tutorial on [Complex-step derivatives](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse2018/blob/master/ComplexStep/ComplexStep.html)

Estimate derivatives by simply passing in a complex number to your function.
A single (complex) function evaluations computes both the function's value **(Re)** and the derivative **(Im)**.
Is it **always** possible to do this? I mean with a standard code form industry (Nastran, Fluent etc...)?

2nd MATLAB tutorial on [gradient evaluation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse2018/blob/master/Sensibility/sensitivity_TD.html)

Comparison of **Symbolic/Finite Differences/DIRECT/ADJOINT Method** on a really simple mechanical system (2DOFs).
Play with the code for **checking** Symbolic with Finite Differences. Play with $$\delta_x$$ ?
By the way, just add the complex step approach, not so difficult when you have access to the **original** code.
Oh, at the end which method is exact? 

3rd MATLAB tutorial Advanced Topology Optimization.

Part A:  [Constraints Agreggation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse2018/blob/master/AdvancedTopOpt/ConstraintsAgreggation.html)
Thanks to my PhD Simone.

Part B:  [Stress Based TopOpt](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse2018/blob/master/AdvancedTopOpt/StressBasedTopOpt.html)
Thanks **AGAIN** to my PhD Simone.
Before you can use Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) as an optimizer in our stress based topology optimization program, you need to obtain the Matlab implementation of MMA from Prof. Krister Svanberg (krille@math.kth.se) from KTH in Stockholm Sweden.
Current MDO project in SUPAERO Engineering program.

4th MATLAB tutorial on regression using [GP, or Kriging](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse2018/blob/master/GP_Tutorial/GP_Tutorial.html)

It's always working ? On interpolation **and** extrapolation ?
By the way, GP is an interpolating **or** regressing method ? Play with the code.

Inspired from Menke's book: Another MATLAB tutorial on [Reduced Order Modeling](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse2018/blob/master/RoM/ROM.html) using SVD/POD approach.

What about MDO ? No MDO without MDA...
Here is a simple example using 
[Fixed Point Iteration ](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse2018/blob/master/MDA/tutorialFPI.html)
